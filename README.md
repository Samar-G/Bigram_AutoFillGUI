# Bigram_AutoFillGUI

	We gathered our corpus from a mental health book which was an encyclopedia about mental health;
	“Mental Health and Mental Disorders_ An Encyclopedia of Conditions, Treatments, and Well-Being”. 
	It had over 700 thousand words. We cleaned the data by removing the first few pages, images and the last few pages. 
	We also removed links and unnecessary elements. 
	We have also removed sections to remove some of the data because it was too big to run as it took a long time. 
	After all of that, we ended up with over 200 thousand words.
